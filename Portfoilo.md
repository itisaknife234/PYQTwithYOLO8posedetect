> 이형규(Hyeong Gyu Lee) - Hekaton99 project
> 
> Inspired by "https://github.com/dscoool/opencv/blob/main/6_pose_detection.py"

> go check the original code If you are interested in

# Intro
> This project is based on YOLO Pose model
> 
> Original code is the code which only can detect the Image only
> 
> So, I add some features that can process the GIF file and Mp4 file

# The Original code

> This is the Orignal code works
> 
> The code is just show the processed image

# Remaked Code
> So, I add some features that user can select the file to process

> and the Capture feature works well
> 
> The Capture file will be placed on the same diractory where the code file located

# Conclusion
> The based code was perfectlty built so remaking the program was easy
> 
> Using the Opencv and make what I intend was hard but there are some pattern and you can easly used on
> 
> I really feel the fun and enjoy to add some features
> 
> Thank you

# ETC
> If you make a exe file by PyInstaller, the folder named "haarcascades" will automatically generated
